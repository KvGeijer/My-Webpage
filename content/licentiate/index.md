# Included Papers

- [**Balanced Allocations over Efficient Queues: A Fast Relaxed FIFO Queue**](https://doi.org/10.1145/3710848.3710892) (PPoPP 2025). **Kåre von Geijer**, Philippas Tsigas, Elias Johansson, Sebastian Hermansson.
  - Will be adapted to fix a mistake in the probabilistic bound, which will change it to _n log n_ whp, but we theorize that it is _n log log n_ or simply _n_ in expectation.
  - Links: [Pdf](./balanced-allocations.pdf), [artifact](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14223245).
- [**Relax and don't Stop: Graph-Aware Asynchronous SSSP**](https://doi.org/10.1145/3711708.3723446) (FCPC at PPoPP 2025). Marco D'Antonio, **Kåre von Geijer**, Thai Son Mai, Philippas Tsigas, Hans Vandierendonck.
  - Won the competition for fastest parallel SSSP solver.
  - Kåre and Marco were lead authors and ordered their names alphabetically.
