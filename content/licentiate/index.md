# Time and Place

The seminar will take place 10:15 - 12 in HA3, at Chalmers Johanneberg Campus. There is also a Zoom link if some participants want to join online: [https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/6890207916?omn=63717143006](https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/6890207916?omn=63717143006).

# Licentiate Thesis

Here is a copy of the thesis PDF: [Semantic Relaxation of Concurrent Queues: Efficient and Elastic Designs](./semantic-relaxation-of-concurrent-data-structures:efficient-and-elastic-designs.pdf), including its appended papers.

The thesis is split in two parts. The first parth is the _thesis overview_, introducing the topic, shared background, and outlines its research questions and contributions. The second part is the _appended papers_, which make up the contributions of the thesis. The appended papers can also be read separately, as they were originally published.

## Included Papers

- [**Balanced Allocations over Efficient Queues: A Fast Relaxed FIFO Queue**](https://doi.org/10.1145/3710848.3710892) (PPoPP 2025). **Kåre von Geijer**, Philippas Tsigas, Elias Johansson, Sebastian Hermansson.
  - This paper has been adapted in the thesis, including a revised analysis, establishing the relaxation bound as _O(n log n)_ with high probability, in place of the previously stated _O(n log log n/ log d)_.
- [**Relax and don't Stop: Graph-Aware Asynchronous SSSP**](https://doi.org/10.1145/3711708.3723446) (FCPC at PPoPP 2025). Marco D'Antonio, **Kåre von Geijer**, Thai Son Mai, Philippas Tsigas, Hans Vandierendonck.
  - Won the competition for fastest parallel SSSP solver at FCPC at PPoPP 2025.
  - Kåre and Marco were lead authors and ordered their names alphabetically.
- [**Elastic Relaxation of Concurrent Data Structures**](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2025.3587888) (TPDS 2025). **Kåre von Geijer**, Philippas Tsigas.
  - This is a continuation of our earlier paper [**How to Relax Instantly: Elastic Relaxation of Concurrent Data Structures**](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-69583-4_9), which won _Best Paper_ at Euro-Par 2024.
