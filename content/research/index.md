# Master Thesis Supervision

I have had the pleasure to supervise a few students through their master's theses. These projects have often led to some interesting results, and have always been very enjoyable to work with. Here is the list of projects I've supervised:

- [Relaxed Priority Queue & Evaluation of Locks](https://odr.chalmers.se/server/api/core/bitstreams/a667a9ce-1ccd-415c-a779-e788c2d10033/content) (2023). Andreas Rudén, Ludvig Andersson.
  - This project explored the creation of a novel relaxed priority queue with discrete priority values. Furthermore, it tried replacing the lock-free sub-queues within the relaxed concurrent queues of the [2D framework](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.DISC.2019.31) with cache-efficient lock-based ones.
