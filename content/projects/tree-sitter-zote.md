I implemented a [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) for [Zote](https://github.com/KvGeijer/zote) and integrated it with my text editor of choice [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/). This was primarily to get syntax highlighting, and to get exposed to some of the internals of modern text editors.
