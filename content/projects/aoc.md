This advent calendar of _small_ programming puzzles has brightened my Decembers since 2020. I did my first year in [Python](https://www.python.org/), then switched to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (which was what hooked me on the language), then [Julia](https://julialang.org/), and most recently [Zote](https://github.com/KvGeijer/zote).

I tried to rise early and solve the problems quickly in 2022, achieving 4 top 1000 placements. In 2023 I again tried to compete, doing better with 26 top 1000 placements, and one top 100!
