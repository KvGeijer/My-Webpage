I have appeared twice as a guest on the Swedish podcast kodsnack (translated as _code chat_), talking both about how I solved [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) with my language [Zote](https://github.com/KvGeijer/zote) as well as my first [published paper](https://karevongeijer.com/research/how-to-relax-instantly.pdf). I enjoy listening to good podcasts, such as Kodsnack, and I hope to continue appearing in episodes every now and then.
