This was my first appearance on a real podcast, and hopefully not the last. I was quite nervous, but had a blast. As expected, I wished I had done many things differently, but it was a fun first attempt. It is also in my opinion a great programming podcast (especially for being in Swedish), and was what inspired me to [switch to Colemak](./blog/switching-to-colemak/) and build a split keyboard.
