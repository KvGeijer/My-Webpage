This is a Christmas-themed programming puzzle for my old flatmate Samuel. It starts off by parsing a strange _syntax tree_, then requiring you to evaluate it with some _binding_ limbs. I recommend it to people who are interested in learning and thinking about parsers and interpreters. It is not that hard, but a bit tricky.
