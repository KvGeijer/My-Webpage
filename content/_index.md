I'm currently a PhD student in the Distributed Computing and Systems group at Chalmers University of Technology, and a few highlights from there can be found on my [**Research**](@/research.md) page. My PhD explores how to speed up massively parallel computations by relaxing the semantics of algorithms, such as allowing queues to return any of the top ten elements instead of only the top. Previously I briefly worked at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com) in Stockholm, developing their network automation products. I have a masters in Engineering mathematics from Lund University, which was a lot of fun.

My [**Blog**](./blog) contains a variety of posts about topics I find interesting or fun. For example, I have a [post](@/blog/confounding-lifetimes/index.md) about what I once (forcibly) learned about invariant lifetimes in Rust. I also summarize a few research topics or articles, such as [Data Structures in the Multicore Age](@/blog/data-structures-in-the-multicore-age/index.md) which sort of is the article kick-starting my research field.
