I'm currently a PhD student in the Distributed Computing and Systems group at Chalmers University of Technology, and a few highlights from there can be found on my [**Research**](@/research/index.md) page. My PhD explores how to speed up massively parallel shared-memory computations by relaxing the semantics of algorithms, such as allowing queues to return any of the ten oldest items instead of only the oldest. Previously I briefly worked at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com) in Stockholm, developing their network automation products. I have a masters in Engineering mathematics from Lund University, where I had five fantastic years.

My [**Blog**](./blog) contains a variety of posts about topics I find interesting or fun. For example, I have a [post](@/blog/confounding-lifetimes/index.md) about what I once (forcibly) learned about invariant lifetimes in Rust. I also summarize a few research topics or articles, such as [Data Structures in the Multicore Age](@/blog/data-structures-in-the-multicore-age/index.md) which sort of is the article that kick-started my research niche.
