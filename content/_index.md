In the [**Blog**](./blog) you can find a variety of posts about topics I find interesting or fun. For example, I have a [post](./blog/confounding-lifetimes/) about what I learned about invariant lifetimes in Rust. Then, the [Research](./research/) feed contains a bit more research-related posts. It's mostly summaries of different fun reasearch papers I have come across, such as [Data Structures in the Multicore Age](./research/data-structures-in-the-multicore-age/) which sort of is the article kick-starting my research field.

I'm currently a PhD student in the Distributed Computing and Systems group at Chalmers University of Technology. Here I research how to speed up massively parallel computations by relaxing the semantics of algorithms, such as allowing queues to return any of the top ten elements instead of only the top. Previously I briefly worked at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com) in Stockholm, developing their network automation products. I have a masters in Engineering mathematics from Lund University, which was a lot of fun.
