Everybody has heard of Frankenstein's monster, but I never knew much more than that it was misunderstood and driven away by humans. Frankly, I did not assume the story or writing would be that interesting. This turned out to be completely wrong, it definitely being worth a read at its mere 200 pages.

Just the act of reading something written over 200 years ago is special. But the sci-fi elements of the story, relating to creating a new form of life, feel way ahead of its time. Furthermore, the story is more nuanced than I thought, depicting both Frankenstein and his monster as a mix of light and dark. What Frankenstein should have done in the middle of the book makes for a nice ethical dilemma.

If you have not yet read this timeless book, I strongly suggest spending a few hours to do so! I don't know what to further say about the book, but I hope it continues to thrive for at least another 200 years.
