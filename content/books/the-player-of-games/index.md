<!-- Abstract -->
This is commonly recommended as a good entry point to [The Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture) book series which envisions a quite utopian humaniod inter-galactic civilization. In the Culture, humanoids and AI machines live together essentially without laws, currency, or scarciity. Although the Culture is largely utopian, adjacent civilizations are not, and the Culture often tries to make contacts with such civilizations to make them more compassionate and just. This book centers around a renown game player from the Culture who is sent as an envoy to an empire build around a type of game. Through following this envoy we experience the jarring differences between the two societies, where the more "barbaric" one bears many similarities to the real world.

<!-- Uninspired protagonist -->
Contrary to many similar books, the protagonist is quite flat and a bit daft. For example, the whole reason he goes on the adventure is that he falls for a rather obvious trick. Thus, he becomes less of a centerpiece, and more of a vehicle of which the reader can experience the world. Although frustrating at times, this makes for a rather nice reading experience in this case.

<!-- Comments on the story (Gurgeh being deceived) -->
When I read the book, I was often frustrated at some story developments. For example, the main character was set up to be a rather mediocre player when playing his first tournament games of _Azad_. However, he then goes on to be among the absolute best in the world, after seemingly very little additional practice. Some of these frustrations persist, but most of them dissipated by the end of the book, as it turned out there were many things the main character (and thus the reader) had not been privy to.

<!-- Maybe write something about how people adapt to their surroundings -->
A fun motif of the book is that people adapt to their surroundings. This is shown in practize as the main character's body physically adapts to the higher gravity at one planet. But more interestingly, the ethos of the main character drifts more and more as he spends time in the empire.

<!-- Conclusions -->
This is a well-written science fiction book. If you generally enjoy sci-fi books, especially ones exploring different world-views, you will very likely enjoy the book. It is a page-turner and I always wanted to know what happened next. I think it would have been fun to explore some of the more interesting parts of the world more, but I guess that is what the sequels are for. Overall, the book keeps a good pace, explores some neat themes and ideas, and creates an interesting world.
