Neuromancer was an early and very influential work within the [cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk) genre. This made it a big hit, as it created a novel and immersive cyberpunk world, full of avatars and cyberspace.

I found the writing style unique and fast-paced, quickly jumping between different people, places, and concepts, often without clear introductions. This style was in part frustrating, as I mostly did not fully understand what was happening. On the flip side, it was also nice to have to figure things out yourself and use your imagination to fill in the blanks in the environment. I think this helped create a fantastical cyberpunk world for me.

While doing some things right, I often felt frustrated while reading this book. The actions of the characters often felt so unbelievable that I could not suspend my disbelief. This was especially apparent when women characters were involved. Therefore I would be hard-pressed to recommend this as a good book, but could recommend reading it due to its historical impact within the cyberpunk genre.
