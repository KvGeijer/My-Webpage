This coming-of-age collection of short stories, taking place in Swansea in South Wales, are inspired by the authors childhood and young adult years. The stories cover topics such as poverty and alcoholism, but also lust and death. Dylan Thomas is by many placed among the best poets of the twentieth century, and this literary prowess could be seen throughout the book.

Although in places great, I found some of the stories a bit too drawn out. This could just be me not appreciating it enough, or in part that I read a translated copy to Swedish. I am also usually not a fan of poetic books or collections of short stories. So, even though this book did not fit me that well, I must concede that parts of it are superb, and would recommend it to people who like this sort of writing.
