I read Snow Crash when I desperately needed a break from [Neuromancer](@/books/neuromancer/index.md), and found it similar, but more enjoyable and well-written in many ways. It might have one of my favorite opening chapters of all time, and proceeds to create an incredibly immersive portrayal of a cyberpunk ultra-capitalistic America after a world-wide economic collapse. Over 30 years later, its portrayal of technology and the metaverse are still relatively realistic and thought provoking.

The book does not only cover technology and capitalism, but also centers around religion, history, linguistics, and much more. This led to quite an ambitious story which was able to explore many interesting fields at the same time, while I for the most part could uphold my immersion.

Sadly, I found that the book sometimes failed to portray realistic meetings between people. This was especially bad with the two(?) named women in the book. If I selectively forget some of these encounters, and some other questionable parts, this is a great book set in a fantastic world with an interesting story. However, I find the drawbacks a bit too major to properly recommend the book.
