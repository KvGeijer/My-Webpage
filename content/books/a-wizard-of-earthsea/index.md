This might be the first book I have read twice, first reading it maybe 15 years ago as a child. After reading some of Le Guin's other works, with generally older demographics, I decided to revisit this young adult novel to see her prowess therein. Her writing continue to impress, and I would warmly recommend it for people around 11-14, or older people who want a nice coming of age magical adventure.

The book centers on the growth in its main character, Ged. Already on the first page, we are recounted the grand achievements of his long life, but this story takes place during his teenage years, before he achieves any of that recognition. It centers around traits such as arrogance, humility, introspection, responsibility, and worldly equilibrium.

I was a bit surprised at the lack of women in the story. They do exist, but it seems only men can be wizards such as Ged, and women instead can become witches. In general, nice women seemed to be traditionally beautiful and caring, whereas the remaining women were scheming and slightly wicked. Although fitting with the time of writing, this characterization of women surprised me a bit, especially considering the author.

Overall, the book is a good coming of age fantasy fable. I heavily enjoyed the writing style, painting the world in vivid but concrete colors, drawing the reader in to the magical Earthsea world.
